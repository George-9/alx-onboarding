.............function for adding the squares of two numbers.

.............get the numbers and if any is 0 return 0.

add(num a, num b)
if a = 0 or b = 0 
print "num cannot be 0"

else
firstSquaredNum = a * a (square of a)
secondSquaredNum = b * b (square b)

find the total of their squares

total = firstSquaredNum + secondSquaredNum
