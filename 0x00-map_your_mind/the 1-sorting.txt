if f is greater than s and t
h add f a first
if s is greater than f and t
h add add s first
if t is greater than f and s
h add a first

if f is greater than s but less than t
container add f sec
if s is greater f but less than t
container add s sec
if t is greater than f but less than s
contaner add t last
